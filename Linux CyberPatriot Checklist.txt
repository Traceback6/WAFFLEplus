PRIORITY
* Open README
* Solve Forensics
* enable/disable ssh (depending on read me)(install openssh-service to enable/ “systemctl stop ssh” then “systemctl disable ssh” to disable)
* Check for daily updates in Software and Updates (Ubuntu specific)
* Remove/Change user accounts/admin privileges
* Fix permissions
* Delete hacking tools (like wireshark)
* Set password requirements. (check below for detail)
* Install and Enable gufw (Terminal> “sudo apt install gufw”> type “gufw” and make status=ON and Incoming=Reject)
* Update software (Terminal> “sudo apt-update” > “sudo apt-upgrade”)
* Change insecure password




Security tools to install (“sudo apt install [PROGRAM NAME]”)
* Clamav (open it with “clamscan” after install)(virus removal tool)
* Gufw(firewall)
* Openssh-server(ssh service)
* libpam-cracklib(creates better password policies)
* Bum (Boot Up Manager) (Use “sudo bum” to run)


Looking for media files
* Use “ls -la” to also view hidden files
* To search for files use “locate *[filetype]”
   * .mp3
   * .mp4
   * .jpg (careful with these as some may be important)
   * .avi
   * .wav
   * .midi
   * .bmp
   * .gif
   * .jpeg
* “rm [PathToFile]”


For solving forensics
* Custom script wip




For password requirements
        Pam.d
1. MAKE SURE libpam-cracklib IS INSTALLED!!!!
2. Through terminal (“cd etc/pam.d/”)
3. “Sudo nano common-password”
4. Find the line that says “pam_unix.so” and add “remember=5”
5. Find the line that says “pam_cracklib.so” and add “ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1” (Enforces password complexity)


1. Through terminal (“sudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth”)
2. At the end of the file add “auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 onerr=fail unlock_time=1800” (Sets the allowed failed login attempts to 5)


        Login.defs
1. Go to terminal (“gedit /etc/login.defs”)
2. Set “PASS_MAX_DAYS” to “90”
3. Set “PASS_MIN_DAYS” to “10”
4. Set “PASS_WARN_AGE” to “7”




Disable guest accounts
1. Go to terminal (“sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf”)(might be “users.conf”)
2. Add the line “allow-guest=false” at the bottom of the file
