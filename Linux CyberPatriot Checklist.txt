PRIORITY
* Open README
* Solve Forensics
* Secure root (terminal > "sudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config" > set PermitRootLogin to "no")
* enable/disable ssh (depending on read me)(install openssh-service to enable/ “systemctl stop ssh” then “systemctl disable ssh” to disable)
* Check for daily updates in Software and Updates (Ubuntu specific)
* Remove/Change user accounts/admin privileges
* Fix permissions
* Delete hacking tools (like wireshark)
* Set password requirements. (check below for detail)
* Install and Enable gufw (Terminal> “sudo apt install ufw”> type “ufw” and make status=ON and Incoming=Reject)
* Update software (Terminal> “sudo apt-update” > “sudo apt-upgrade”)
* Change insecure password



Security tools to install (“sudo apt install [PROGRAM NAME]”)
* Clamav (open it with “clamscan” after install)(virus removal tool)
* ufw(firewall)
* Openssh-server(ssh service)
* libpam-cracklib(creates better password policies)
* Bum (Boot Up Manager) (Use “sudo bum” to run)


Looking for media files and hacking tools
* Before manually checking for files, cd into the "/home" directory and run "sudo ls -Ra *"
* Use “ls -la” to also view hidden files
* To search for files use “locate *[filetype]”
   * .mp3
   * .mp4
   * .jpg (careful with these as some may be important)
   * .avi
   * .wav
   * .midi
   * .bmp
   * .gif
   * .jpeg
   * .pdf
   * A TEXT FILE CONTAINING ALL THE USER PASSWORDS
* “rm [PathToFile]”


For solving forensics
* If you need to find a user ID in terminal > "id -u <username>"
* Custom script wip


For password requirements
        Pam.d
1. MAKE SURE libpam-cracklib IS INSTALLED!!!!
2. Through terminal (“cd etc/pam.d/”)
3. “Sudo gedit common-password”
4. Find the line that says “pam_unix.so” and add “remember=5”
5. Find the line that says “pam_cracklib.so” and add “ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1” (Enforces password complexity)


1. Through terminal (“sudo gedit /etc/pam.d/common-auth”)
2. At the end of the file add “auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5 onerr=fail unlock_time=1800” (Sets the allowed failed login attempts to 5)


        Login.defs
1. Go to terminal (“sudo gedit /etc/login.defs”)
2. Set “PASS_MAX_DAYS” to “90”
3. Set “PASS_MIN_DAYS” to “10”
4. Set “PASS_WARN_AGE” to “7”


ports stuff
        1. Use "sudo ss -ln" to display all ports
        2. Look into any port that doesn't have "127.0.0.1" if the readme doesn't specify it (still make sure you know what you're doing)
        3. To close a port use "sudo lsof -i :$port"


Networking stuff (more advanced. Don't worry about these until later rounds.)
        * Enable syn cookie protection ("systemctl -n net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies")
        * Disable IPv6 (Potentially harmful! Only under certain conditions.) ("echo "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf")
        * Disable IP Forwarding ("echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward")
        * Prevent IP Spoofing ("echo "nospoof on" | sudo tee -a /etc/host.conf")

SUS Users(AMONGUSAMONGUSAMONGUSAMONGUSAMONGUSAMONGUS)
        In terminal run ("cat /etc/passwd") and look for people that are:
                * uid 0
                * can login
                * Are allowed in the readme (CPDiscord told me about this one)
        
        Find fake admins/roots 
                * go to "/etc/sudoers.d" and make sure only authorized people can sudo
                * go to "/etc/group" and remove any non-admins from sudo and admin groups



Disable guest accounts
1. Go to terminal (“sudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf”)(might be “users.conf”)
2. Add the line “allow-guest=false” at the bottom of the file


Tools and extras:
* http://whois.domaintools.com/
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/features
* Check service configuration files for required services. Sometimes can get a point for finding a wrong setting in a config file for sql, apache, etc.
