Registry Editor hives explained (if you ever need to use it)
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) -
   This Hive contains the preferences and configuration for the particular user who is currently logged in. 
   If a different user is logged onto the same machine, then the information in this Hive would change corresponding to that particular user's configuration.
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM) -
   This Hive contains the configuration for the actual computer. 
   The information in this Hive remains the same regardless of the user currently logged on.
* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR) -
   This Hive contains the information which pertains to the core user interface such as file associations and shortcuts.
* HKEY_USERS (HKU) -
   This Hive contains the user information for all the users that have ever logged onto this computer.
* HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC) -
   This Hive contains the information about current hardware configuration. This Hive is linked to the HKLM Hive.
* HKEY_DYN_DATA (HKDD) -
   This Hive is found only on Windows 95/98/ME. It contains information about hardware Plug and Play. 
   This Hive is linked to the HKLM Hive.

Removing Malware (You will probably only need step 1)
1. Install antivirus (Malwarebytes is what CyberPatriot recommends)
2. If for SOME reason you still think malware is on the computer, look into the following:
   *Process Explorer(Gives detailed information about running processes(includes virus count))(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)
   *Process Monitor(Gives detailed info about file system, registry, and thread activity)(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)
   *TCPView(lists all programs on the computer that are connected to a remote computer)(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/tcpview)
